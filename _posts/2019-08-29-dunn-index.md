title: Dunn index for clusters analysis
categories: python clustering programming
---

This is a Python implementation of the Dunn index, which is used to evaluate clustering results. While, officially, I followed the reference below, unnoficially, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_index) was a lot more helpful in this endeavour.

I also want to thank the people who used the code and commented in the GitHub gist where the code below is hosted. I received many bug reports and useful suggestions.
