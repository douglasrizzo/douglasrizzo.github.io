I worked as an AI Research Specialist at Samsung, specializing in digital health solutions for wearable devices. I also automated citrus orchard monitoring at Adroit Robotics using computer vision techniques. My PhD, funded by CAPES, centered on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning using graph neural networks. I have extensive experience in robotics competitions, focusing on developing object detection systems for the robots. I've also worked as a consultant and have publications in the area of educational assessment and computerized adaptive tests.","location":{"countryCode":"US","address":"Brazil"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"douglas-de-rizzo-meneghetti-65757720","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-de-rizzo-meneghetti-65757720/"}]},"work":[{"name":"Orbia","position":"Senior Machine Learning Engineer","startDate":"2024-07-31","endDate":"","highlights":[],"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/orbia-ag/","location":"São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil"},{"name":"Samsung Brasil","position":"AI Research Specialist","startDate":"2023-06-30","endDate":"2024-06-30","highlights":[],"summary":"Contributed to the research and development of digital health solutions for mobile and wearable devices.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsungbrasil/","location":"Campinas, São Paulo, Brasil"},{"name":"Adroit Robotics","position":"Machine Learning Specialist","startDate":"2021-07-31","endDate":"2023-03-31","highlights":[],"summary":"- Implemented a Faster R-CNN object detection system to find tree seedlings, dead trees and large replants in citrus orchards, as well as a counting algorithm for unproductive tree slots.\n- Trained image classifiers (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer) to detect different levels of lens flare in outdoors photos.\n- Optimized PyTorch-based machine learning pipelines for fast execution in the cloud (using prefetching in the GPU, threaded downloads, multiprocessing).\n- Adapted machine learning codebases and migrated Docker images to be executed in AWS Batch.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/adroit-robotics/","location":"São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil"},{"name":"The University Center of FEI","position":"Scholarship Holder","startDate":"2017-03-31","endDate":"2021-05-31","highlights":[],"summary":"- Created an object detection system in TensorFlow + ROS used by a Latin American award winning domestic robot.\n- Created deep neural networks for multi-agent reinforcement learning system in PyTorch.\n- Maintainer of an open source academic formatting software adopted institution-wide..\n- Organizer of AI graduate students study group.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/fei-online/","location":"São Paulo Area, Brazil"},{"name":"Secretaria Municipal de Educação de São Paulo","position":"Software Development Consultant","startDate":"2016-04-30","endDate":"2016-12-31","highlights":[],"summary":"Sole developer of a full-stack Java EE mobile web application for large scale educational assessment (Provinha Brasil) of elementary grade students.","url":""},{"name":"The University Center of FEI","position":"Researcher","startDate":"2014-04-30","endDate":"2014-12-31","highlights":[],"summary":"- Functional and usability tester for an electronic health record system.\n- Responsible for database and server maintenance as well as software documentation.\n- Project was a partnership between FEI University Center, Volans and Hospital Heliópolis, with funding provided by FINEP.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/fei-online/"},{"name":"Cloud Ideas","position":"Software Developer","startDate":"2012-01-31","endDate":"2012-07-31","highlights":[],"summary":"Responsible for the development in all layers of the MVC pattern and for the object-relational mapping and database modelling using Entity Framework Code First.","url":"","location":"São Paulo, Brazil"},{"name":"Enygma Tecnologia","position":"Software Developer","startDate":"2011-06-30","endDate":"2012-01-31","highlights":[],"summary":"Collaborated in developing a system to send electronic receipts for the federal government using ASP.NET Web Forms, the FlexDocs library, SQL Server 2008 and DevExpress web components.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/enygma---tecnologia-em-informatica/","location":"São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil"}],"volunteer":[],"education":[{"institution":"Wizard by Pearson","area":"English","studyType":"","startDate":"2007-12-31","endDate":"2010-12-31","score":"","courses":["Basic english","Intermediate english","Advanced english"]},{"institution":"The University Center of FEI","area":"Artificial Intelligence","studyType":"Master of Science -
