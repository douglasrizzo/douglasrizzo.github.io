Finished my PhD in Artificial Intelligence with a full scholarship by CAPES, in which I tackled the problem of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with heterogeneous agents in cooperative tasks using graph neural networks.\n\nActive for many years in robotics competitions (LARC and RoboCup) in the @Home and Humanoid Soccer categories, in which I focused in developing object detection systems for the robots.\n\nDone research and professional work as a consultant in educational assessment, more specifically, computerized adaptive tests.\n\nAs a software developer, I have worked full-stack with Java Enterprise applications, PostgreSQL and Linux stacks. More recently, I've been authoring and documenting open source Python packages dedicated to machine learning research.\n\nAll the interesting projects I am working on are held in my GitHub page.
