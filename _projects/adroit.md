During my stay at Adroit Robotics, I:

- Developed a Faster R-CNN object detection system to find tree seedlings, dead trees and large replants in citrus orchards, as well as a counting algorithm for unproductive tree slots.
- Trained image classifiers (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer) to detect different levels of lens flare in outdoors photos.
- Optimized PyTorch-based machine learning pipelines for fast execution in the cloud (using prefetching in the GPU, threaded downloads, multiprocessing).\n- 
- Adapted machine learning codebases and migrated Docker images to be executed in AWS Batch.
