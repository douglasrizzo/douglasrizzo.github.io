A LaTeX class used by [FEI University Center](http://www.fei.edu.br/) students to author their term papers, masters dissertations and doctoral theses under the institution typographical rules. The document class, a `.tex` template file and the PDF documentation are available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/fei). There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/douglasrizzo/Classe-Latex-FEI/wiki) for miscellanoues tips and a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grupo-latex-fei) (in Portuguese) for me to communicate with users.
