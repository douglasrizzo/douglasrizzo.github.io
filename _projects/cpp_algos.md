These were implemented in C++:

- [machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms](http://douglasrizzo.com.br/machine_learning/)
- [numerical analysis procedures](http://douglasrizzo.com.br/numerical_analysis/)
- [full-fledged matrix class](http://douglasrizzo.com.br/matrix/)

They may not be directly useful in third-party projects, as they are not as optimized as their commercial counterparts, but they are nonetheless well documented for those interested in learning.
