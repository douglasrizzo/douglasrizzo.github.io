AI specialist with a history in software engineering.

I am currently an AI Research Specialist at Samsung. Previously, I worked at [Adroit Robotics](projects/adroit), automating the monitoring of citrus orchards using computer vision techniques.

During my PhD, which I finished with a full scholarship by CAPES, I worked in the field of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learnings. My research focused on the problem of fully cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with heterogeneous agents.

I was active for many years in robotics competitions (LARC and RoboCup) in the @Home and Humanoid Soccer categories, in which I focused in developing [object detection systems for the robots](projects/dodo_detector).

I've also done professional work as a consultant and have publications in the area of educational assessment and [computerized adaptive tests](projects#computerized-adaptive-testing).

### Would you like to know more?

I like to make stuff open for everybody. The things I build are kept in my [GitHub repositories](repositories) and the things I learn are kept in my [blog](blog). My [projects page](projects) lists the things I'm proud of. [ArtStation](https://douglasrizzo.artstation.com/) has my 3D art. [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1293596) has my stupid questions and answers. Also check my [publications](publications).
