I am an AI specialist with a background in software engineering, working with [natural language processing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-022-01322-7), [large language models](blog/tag/llms/), [computer vision](projects/#computer vision) and [reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07617).

I worked as an AI Research Specialist at Samsung, specializing in digital health solutions for wearable devices. I also automated citrus orchard monitoring at Adroit Robotics using [computer vision techniques](https://wandb.ai/tetamusha/fruit_detection_torchvision/reports/Detecting-oranges-with-TorchVision--Vmlldzo4MDAyNzM). My PhD, funded by CAPES, centered on [cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07617) using graph neural networks.

I have extensive experience in robotics competitions, in which I focused in developing [object detection systems for the robots](projects/dodo_detector). I've also done professional work as a consultant and have publications in the area of educational assessment and [computerized adaptive tests](projects#computerized adaptive testing).

### Would you like to know more?

I like to make stuff open for everybody. The things I build are kept in my [GitHub repositories](repositories) and the things I learn are kept in my [blog](blog). My [projects page](projects) lists the things I'm proud of. [ArtStation](https://douglasrizzo.artstation.com/) has my 3D art. [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1293596) has my stupid questions and answers. Also check my [publications](publications).
