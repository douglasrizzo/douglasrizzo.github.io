Hi there. I do research on AI. I also like to code. My CV is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-de-rizzo-meneghetti-65757720). List of publications is available at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V30JReAAAAAJ).

### Research

My PhD research started with an interest in teaching AI agents how to play electronic games, both new and old. My specific interests are in teaching multiple heterogeneous agents how to accomplish a task. I've been trying to do it using neural networks.

I've also worked with and have publications in the areas of [object detection](projects#object-detection-and-robotics), robotics and [computerized adaptive tests](projects#computerized-adaptive-testing).

### Would you like to know more?

I like to make stuff open for everybody. The things I build are kept in my [GitHub](https://github.com/douglasrizzo) and the things I learn are kept in my [blog](blog). My [projects page](projects) lists the things I'm proud of. [Instagram](https://instagram.com/douglasrizzom) has my 3D art. [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1293596/douglas-de-rizzo-meneghetti) has my stupid questions. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Tetamusha) has videos of my projects.
